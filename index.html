	<h2>HTML Exercise</h2>
	<p>This is a small change!</p>

	<h3>Previously ...</h3>
	<ul>
    	<li>You looked at the HTML that made up a <a href="http://edinburgh.codefirstgirls.org.uk/courses/html/sample.html">sample page</a></li>
    	<li>You looked at the HTML that made up one of your favourite sites</li>
    	<li>You changed the attribute of an img tag to change the picture it showed</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Now ...</h4>
	<p>You should:</p>
    <ol>
    	<li>look at the picture of this site</li>
    	<li>Try and match up the look of the site to HTML that you've seen so far</li>
    	<li>Now build that HTML in your own index.html page</li>
    	<li>Check the page in a web browser to see how it compares</li>
    	<li>Look back to the slides if you want</li>
    </ol>
<p> Here's a picture of a cat</p>
    <img src="./cat.png" />
